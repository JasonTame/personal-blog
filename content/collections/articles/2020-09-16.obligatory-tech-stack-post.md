I'm sure its becoming a bit of a meme that every developer has an over-engineered blog site with a single post that details the fancy tech stack it was built with. 

I'm hoping this is not yet another example of that.

I will admit that I have started this blog at least 5 times using different technologies since ditching my old WordPress.com blog a couple of years ago. I've tried headless WordPress, NetlifyCMS, Sanity.io, Storyblok and a couple others. All of them worked fine, I just got too caught up in trying to make it perfect before launching.

This time I followed the readme, pushed it to git and started writing. No customisation at all. If I get through a couple blog posts, I'll maybe give it some personalisation if I stick with it.

Anyway, on to the tech! 

This site is built using [Statamic 3](https://statamic.com/) and through the use of the [Statamic SSG package](https://github.com/statamic/ssg), it is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as a static site. I write my content on my local machine using the absolutely beautiful editor, it gets saved as a markdown file, and when I push up to github, it triggers a deployment.

![Statamic example](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkn9wtsgs/image/upload/v1600285114/blog/Screenshot_2020-09-16_Obligatory_tech_stack_post_Articles_Collections_Statamic.png)

Statamic itself is a Laravel package. [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is an excellent PHP framework and my go-to option for building web applications these days, so it's a comfortable option for me.

The front-end of the site is using a [Statamic starter kit called Cool Writings](https://github.com/statamic/starter-kit-cool-writings) which is pretty nice clean minimalist look. It's fairly easy to customise using the [Antlers templating language](https://v2.statamic.com/antlers) which is similar to Blade or Twig. 

Statamic 3 has only recently come out and does have a [completely free plan for solo users and hobbyists](https://statamic.com/pricing). It has most of the features of the paid plan, however it is missing some of the team-focused features and a few cool things like revisions and git integrations with the control panel. I don't feel like I'm going to miss these things on a personal blog, so I'm  happy to stick with the generous free plan for now. 

Thus far, I am really impressed with the onboarding process as well as the excellent control panel and customisation options. I also think it has a lot of potential longer term as its very flexible - if I decide I want a JS-powered frontend, it can be decoupled and run in headless mode using the content api. If I would rather use a mySQL database instead of markdown, I change that too. 

Statamic feels like a tool that can adapt to my needs really well, so I'm pretty optimistic about it. If you are looking to start a blog site and are comfortable with markdown and git, I'd highly recommend that you give it a shot.
