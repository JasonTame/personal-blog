# Intro

Pest is a testing framework built on PHPUnit. According to the createor it was "carefully crafted to bring the joy of testing to PHP".

It cuts out a lot of boilerplate that you'd generally need to write when testing with PHPUnit and instead lets you focus on the tests themselves. 

Benefits:

- 1 Great test reporting
- 2 It's super easy to write and read Pest tests

## Installation

[Link to official install docs
](https://pestphp.com/docs/installation/)
As mentioned, Pest is built on top of PHPUnit, so the first step is to make sure you have a phpunit.xml file at the project root. If you are using Laravel, it usually comes with one in a standard installation. Otherwise, here's [a link to one](https://github.com/pestphp/pest/blob/master/stubs/Laravel/phpunit.xml) on the pest repo

Next, make sure your PHPUnit dependency is ^9.0

```
composer require phpunit/phpunit:"^9.0" --dev --update-with-dependencies
```

If you are using Laravel, require Collision ^5.0

```
composer require nunomaduro/collision:"^5.0" --dev --update-with-dependencies
```

**Note:** Collision 5.0 requires Laravel 8.0 or above. If you are on an older version, skip this step. You can still run PestPHP if you are on an older version of Laravel, but you will have to call it with `./vendor/bin/pest` rather than `php artisan test`.
